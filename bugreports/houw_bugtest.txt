For this report, I used random and unit testing for this person's code. I have discovered two bugs that makes
the card game incorrect. One of the bug he has is the card effect for great hall. Although the function is executable,
the effect of the card function is incorrect. It does not allow the player to draw a card after Great Hall is played.
On line 684, it should have a drawCard(player,state) function inside of cardEffect_great_hall().

Another bug that I have found in this person's code is the function card smithy. The function was executable, but
my testing shows that the 4th player's hand card number does not change. It has shown that after the card was
played, the 4th player's hand card number did not changed due to the logic error in the for loop. In line 665, the
maximum player goes to 3 instead of 4. Simply changed the condition to 4 in the for loop will fix the problem.
