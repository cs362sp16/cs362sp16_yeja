For this report, I used random and unit testing for this person's code. While testing, I found a bug in one of the
card. The card named adventurer has an error which it does not show the right amount of cards in the player's hand
after it was played. The player's handCount should decrease if it was played right. To fix this, simply make the
handCount decrement by one after two treasure card has drawn.
