For this report, I used random and unit testing for this person's code. I have discovered a bug where one of
the card is incorrect. The card steward has an error which it doesn't discard the right amount of cards when played.
During my testing, it failed to do so. The function only discard one card instead of two cards. To fix this, simply
add another discardCard() on line 876.
